The term has been around for so long and used by so many people you would think there is no differing opinion to the definition. But ask people what they mean by that term and you'll get surprisingly different answers. Sure, there's a large overlap, but there are also meaningful differences.

Broadly Network Automation is moving automation tools between the Network Operator and the CLI. These tools should support the Operator in increased network reliability, agility and responsiveness to business demands.
