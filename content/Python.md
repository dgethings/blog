An interpreted language that has become one of the main programming languages used in [[Network Automation]].

What's great about Python is the low barrier to entry to get started. You don't need much more that an installation of Python, a library or two and a script that fits into a single file.

But that's doesn't mean Python is easy. As your ambitions become great, so does the effort to make Python code maintainable. The classic [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1987/)
exemplifies the mess that is the many attempts to standardise Python packaging.

To be fair there is a lot of effort going into solving this. Projects like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) (to name but a few) are bringing this into the modern era. But even then, it's not straight forward.
