This website is my public thoughts on [[Network Automation]]. These are my own personal thoughts and are in no way a representation of whichever company I have or am working for.

This isn't your regular blog site. It's more of a wiki or, if you like to be fancy, a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). This mean that pages will change over time as my thoughts on topics change. Most pages will linked to other pages so you can see associations. There will be some "true" blog posts: topical, moment in time pieces. But these will be the exception.

Anyway, to get started the best thing to look at the most recently updated pages which are the list on the left.
